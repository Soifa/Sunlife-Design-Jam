    <h2>🔍 The Challenge</h2>
    <p>How might we help young adults find, engage in, and actually use financial tools and education?</p>
    <p>Many people feel overwhelmed by financial information. We wanted to simplify this learning journey using behavioural insights and interactive design.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>💡 The Solution</h2>
    <p>We created a gamified mobile app where users nurture a virtual pet by completing short, personalized lessons about budgeting, credit, and saving.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🎮 Choose a virtual pet</li>
      <li>📘 Learn through quizzes and lessons</li>
      <li>🏆 Earn rewards for progress</li>
      <li>💬 Connect with peers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧠 Applying the EAST Framework</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Easy:</strong> Clear UI, no jargon, step-by-step</li>
      <li><strong>Attractive:</strong> Cute pets, gamification, rewards</li>
      <li><strong>Social:</strong> Peer progress boards, share features</li>
      <li><strong>Timely:</strong> Nudges tied to real-life events and paydays</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>👥 User Personas</h2>
  <p>We focused on two key personas to guide our user-centered design approach:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Maria:</strong> A 33-year-old software engineer who recently started her first job. She faces student debt, credit card challenges, and anxiety around financial management. She needs simple tools, friendly guidance, and a low-barrier way to start saving and learning.</li>
    <li><strong>Alex:</strong> A 24-year-old marketing intern just beginning his career. He is interested in investing but lacks foundational knowledge and feels overwhelmed by the complexity of available tools. He needs confidence-building support and beginner-friendly education.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎨 UX & Visual Design</h2>
  <p>Our design process was structured across four key phases: discovery, ideation, prototyping, and testing. We prioritized clarity, emotional connection, and behavioral design at every step.</p>

  <h3>📌 Discovery Phase</h3>
  <p>We began by analyzing common financial literacy pain points, reviewing competitor apps, and identifying emotional blockers like fear and information overload. Using the EAST framework as our foundation, we set out to create a more motivating, playful alternative.</p>

  <h3>🧠 Ideation Phase</h3>
  <p>We generated a variety of low-fidelity wireframes that explored gamification, habit-building, and emotional reinforcement through virtual companions. From the start, we knew we wanted to balance education with joy — so users would feel excited to return.</p>

    <img src="sunlife-wireframe.png" alt="Sun Life Wireframes" style="width: 100%; max-width: 900px; border-radius: 16px; box-shadow: 0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);">
  </div>

  <h3>🧪 Prototyping Phase</h3>
  <p>We built a clickable high-fidelity prototype featuring a warm, earthy color palette and friendly UI. The layout was intentionally simple, with clearly labeled progress paths, daily goals, and options to grow a customizable financial buddy pet.</p>

  <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; gap: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem;">

  </div>

  <h3>🔁 Testing & Feedback</h3>
  <p>We received encouraging feedback that users appreciated the gentle tone, gamified reward system, and pet customization. Our app reduced the cognitive load of traditional finance apps by making learning feel casual and even fun.</p>
